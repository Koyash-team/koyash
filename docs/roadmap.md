## Sprint 1 — Core recommendation happy path

- **Milestone:** [Sprint 1](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/milestone/1)
- **Dates:** 2026-06-15 – 2026-06-21
- **Sprint Goal:** Deliver the core recommendation happy path — a guided questionnaire (budget, ethical preferences, allergen exclusion, skin concerns) producing a structured cosmetic bag of real products with per-item justification, deployed and ready for customer review. This is the MVP v1 increment.
- **Focus:** Ship the `/recommend` backend end-to-end, then build the questionnaire and results frontend on top of it.
- **Planned items:**
  - User stories: [US-02](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/6), [US-03](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/7), [US-04](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/8), [US-05](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/9), [US-06](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/10), [US-07](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/11), [US-08](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/12), [US-17](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/21)

## Sprint 2 — Polish the MVP, personalize by skin type, raise quality and automation

- **Milestone:** [Sprint 2](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/milestone/2)
- **Dates:** 2026-06-22 – 2026-06-28 (Mon–Sun)
- **Sprint Goal:** Polish the MVP for real customer use: apply the customer's requested design and copy changes on the frontend, add automated tests for the product-recommendation (matching) logic and fix any defects they surface, and extend the recommendation engine with skin type as a new filtering criterion (database markup, questionnaire step, and matching logic).
- **Focus:** Customer-feedback-driven design/copy fixes, skin-type personalization, a short non-storytelling questionnaire variant, automated testing of the recommendation engine, and the Assignment 4 quality/automation baseline (Quality Requirements, QRTs, CI gates, Definition of Done, testing and UAT docs).
- **Planned items:**
  - User stories: [US-01](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/5) (landing page), [US-09](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/13) (skin type), [US-18](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/69) (short questionnaire variant)
  - Skin type: [PBI-201](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/70), [PBI-202](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/71)
  - Design/frontend: [PBI-203](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/72), [PBI-204](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/73), [PBI-205](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/74)
  - Testing and quality automation: [PBI-206](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/75), [PBI-207](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/76), [PBI-208](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/77), [PBI-209](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/78), [PBI-210](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/79), [PBI-211](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/80), [PBI-212](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/81)

## Sprint 3 — MVP v2: more accurate, more personal, better explained

- **Milestone:** [Sprint 3](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/milestone/3)
- **Dates:** 2026-06-29 – 2026-07-05 (Mon–Sun)
- **Sprint Goal:** Make the budget expectation honest — present budget as a tier with an approximate total instead of promising an exact ₽ range; let users who don't know their skin type get a personalized result through a short skin-type mini-quiz; integrate LLM-generated justifications for the recommended products; and apply the customer's design and copy feedback. In parallel, document the product architecture (static/dynamic/deployment views and ADRs) and the development process.
- **Focus:** Customer-feedback-driven product improvements (budget precision, design/copy), the skin-type mini-quiz, LLM justifications (justification-only — model and prompt provided by the customer), and the Assignment 5 maintained documentation (architecture, ADRs, development process, hosted docs).
- **Delivered increment:** MVP v2, mapped to release `v1.2.0`.
- **Planned items:**
  - User stories: [US-19](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/101) (skin-type mini-quiz), [US-14](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/18) (LLM justification), [US-20](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/124) (special-condition safety)
  - Product: [PBI-301](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/102) (mini-quiz), [PBI-302](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/103) (budget precision), [PBI-303](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/104) (LLM justifications), [PBI-304](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/105) (design/copy polish), [PBI-312](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/125) (special-condition filter)
  - Architecture & process: [PBI-305](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/106)–[PBI-308](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/109) (static/dynamic/deployment views, ADRs), [PBI-309](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/110) (development process), [PBI-310](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/111) (hosted docs), [PBI-311](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/112) (tests, UATs, Definition of Done)

## Sprint 4 — Personal account: sign-in, profile, history and feedback (Week 6 trial)

- **Milestone:** [Sprint 4](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/milestone/4)
- **Dates:** 2026-07-06 – 2026-07-12 (Mon–Sun)
- **Sprint Goal:** Turn Koyash from an anonymous one-shot tool into a personal service. Users can register and sign in (email + password; a phone number is collected but not used for authentication), while the questionnaire → cosmetic-bag flow stays fully available to guests without an account. Signed-in users get a personal account: a profile card, saved cosmetic-bag history (with the query that produced each bag), and like/dislike feedback on recommended products. In parallel, publish the customer-facing documentation set and cut the Week 6 trial release `v1.3.0`.
- **Focus:** Guest-first authentication, the personal account (profile, history, feedback), the Assignment 6 customer-facing docs (README entry point, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/customer-handover.md`), ADR-004 for authentication, and a stable trial release for the Week 6 customer trial and transition-readiness meeting.
- **Planned items:**
  - User stories: [US-21](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/136) (account + sign-in), [US-22](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/137) (profile card), [US-12](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/16) (cosmetic-bag history), [US-13](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/17) ("worked / didn't work" feedback)
  - Product: [PBI-401](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/140)–[PBI-407](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/146) (auth backend/frontend, profile, history backend/frontend, feedback backend/frontend)
  - Architecture, quality & docs: [PBI-408](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/147) (ADR-004 + config), [PBI-409](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/148) (auth/history tests), [PBI-410](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/149) (README entry point), [PBI-411](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/150) (CONTRIBUTING/AGENTS), [PBI-412](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/151) (customer-handover), [PBI-413](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/152) (trial release v1.3.0)

## Sprint 5 — Trial feedback, favorites, progress check-in and final transition (Week 7, MVP v3)

- **Milestone:** [Sprint 5](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/milestone/5)
- **Dates:** 2026-07-13 – 2026-07-19 (Mon–Sun)
- **Sprint Goal:** Respond to the Week 6 trial feedback and complete the transition: add favorites and a lightweight skin-progress check-in, fold in customer-requested fixes, finalize the customer-handover documentation and confirmation, and ship the final course version, `MVP v3`.
- **Focus:** Week 6 customer-trial follow-up. Part of this scope is expected follow-up that depends on the trial feedback, so additional fix PBIs and the final-transition and MVP v3 release work will be added during the week.
- **Delivered increment:** MVP v3 (final course version).
- **Planned items:**
  - User stories: [US-23](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/138) (favorites), [US-24](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/139) (monthly skin-progress check-in)
  - Product: [PBI-501](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/153) (favorites), [PBI-502](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/154) (lightweight tracker / check-in)
  - Tentative: [US-11](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/15) (irritant warning) — only if the customer opens up ingredient analysis; still pending that decision.
  - Follow-up fixes from the Week 6 trial, the final `docs/customer-handover.md` and transition confirmation, and the final MVP v3 release + public demo video will be added as PBIs during Week 7.

## Backlog / later (not scheduled)

- Product photo on each card ([US-10](https://github.com/Koyash-team/koyash/issues/14)); a mobile version. Full skin-progress tracking beyond the lightweight Sprint 5 check-in (daily habit calendar, dynamics charts, before/after photos) remains a product vision, not scheduled course work.

## Continuing work (maintained across Sprints)

The architecture documentation and ADRs, quality requirements and quality requirement tests, CI quality gates, Definition of Done, and the hosted documentation site introduced or maintained in Assignments 4–5 are maintained assets. Later Sprints must keep them current as product scope, architecture, deployment model, or workflow change.
