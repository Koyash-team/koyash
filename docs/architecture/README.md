# KOYASH Architecture

This is the maintained architecture index for KOYASH. It documents the current
delivered system — the structures, components, and decisions needed to reason
about how the product works, how it is deployed, and how it can evolve.

KOYASH is a skincare recommendation service: a **React + Vite** single-page
frontend collects the user's budget, ethical preferences, allergens, skin
concerns, and skin type, and a **FastAPI** backend turns that into a structured
"cosmetic bag" of real products with a per-product justification. Product data
lives in **MongoDB Atlas**. In MVP v2 an **LLM justification layer**
(gpt-4o-mini, justification-only) is being added on top of the existing
rule-based engine.

This document is built up across the Sprint 3 architecture PBIs:

- **Static view** — component diagram + commentary (this PR, PBI-305) ✅
- **Dynamic view** — `/recommend` sequence diagram (PBI-306) — _in progress_
- **Deployment view** — Railway + MongoDB Atlas (PBI-307) — _in progress_
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** — at least three, linked to quality
  requirements (PBI-308) — _in progress_

Maintained architecture assets live under:

- [`static-view/`](static-view/) — static structure (component diagram)
- [`dynamic-view/`](dynamic-view/) — runtime behaviour (sequence diagrams)
- [`deployment-view/`](deployment-view/) — deployment / runtime topology
- `adr/` — Architecture Decision Records

Quality requirements referenced below are defined in
[`docs/quality-requirements.md`](../quality-requirements.md) and verified by the
tests in [`docs/quality-requirement-tests.md`](../quality-requirement-tests.md).

### What the diagram shows

The diagram captures the main internal components, the external systems they
talk to, and the protocols between them.

- **Frontend (React + Vite SPA, served on Railway).** The landing page and the
  three questionnaire flows (storytelling, short, and the new skin-type
  mini-quiz) collect the user's answers. A request builder
  (`quizConfig.buildRequest`) assembles them into the `/recommend` payload, and
  the results view renders the returned cosmetic bag. The frontend talks to the
  backend only over **HTTPS**, calling `POST /recommend` (and `GET /products`).
- **Backend (FastAPI on Uvicorn, on Railway).** `main.py` wires CORS and exposes
  `/health`. Two routers handle the API surface: `POST /recommend` and
  `GET /products`. The **recommendation engine** (`app/api/recommend.py`) applies
  the hard filters (vegan and cruelty-free as a MongoDB query; allergens
  case-insensitively in Python), then does segment-priority selection, skin-type
  preference, and basket assembly. The **rule-based justification builder**
  produces the per-product explanation today; in MVP v2 the **LLM justification
  layer** (ADR-001) enriches that text using gpt-4o-mini, with a fallback to the
  rule-based text. **Data access** is a thin Motor (async MongoDB) client, and
  **config** is centralized in pydantic settings read from the environment.
- **External systems.** **MongoDB Atlas** stores the `products` collection,
  reached over the MongoDB wire protocol (TLS) via Motor. The **LLM provider**
  (OpenAI-compatible endpoint, gpt-4o-mini) is reached over HTTPS REST. The
  **data seed scripts** in [`db/`](../../db/) populate Atlas offline from the
  source dataset and are not part of the request path.

### Coupling and cohesion

- **Frontend ↔ backend are loosely coupled** through a single, explicit HTTP
  JSON contract (`RecommendRequest` / `RecommendResponse` pydantic models). They
  share no code and deploy independently — the frontend only depends on the
  shape of the API response.
- **The recommendation engine is highly cohesive but concentrated.** One module
  (`recommend.py`) owns hard filtering, segment fallback, skin preference,
  basket assembly, and (today) justification. That makes the core logic easy to
  locate and test, but the module is large; the selection logic and the
  justification logic are already separate functions, which is the natural seam
  to split along as the LLM layer and budget work grow.
- **External dependencies are isolated behind accessors.** The engine reaches
  the database only through `get_database()` / Motor, and the allergen filter
  deliberately runs in application code rather than in the database query. The
  LLM layer is introduced as a separate component the justification step calls,
  not as a dependency baked into selection — so the deterministic engine stays
  decoupled from the LLM.
- **Configuration is centralized** in one pydantic `Settings` object sourced
  from environment variables, so runtime/secret configuration is not scattered
  across modules.

### Maintainability implications

- The clear HTTP contract gives a stable, testable boundary between the two
  deployables (supports **Testability**) and lets the frontend and backend
  evolve on independent release cadences.
- Keeping selection deterministic and the LLM strictly additive (ADR-001) means
  MVP v2 can add richer explanations without putting an external, variable-latency
  service on the critical selection path — protecting **modifiability** and
  performance headroom.
- The main maintainability risk is the size of `recommend.py`: as the LLM layer
  (PBI-303) and budget-precision work (PBI-302) land, splitting selection and
  justification into separate modules will keep each change local and reviewable.

### Quality requirements this structure supports or constrains

- **[QR-001 — Allergen-safe recommendations](../quality-requirements.md#qr-001-allergen-safe-recommendations)
  (Functional correctness).** The allergen exclusion lives in application code
  inside the engine, in one place, so it can be verified directly and
  continuously (QRT-001) rather than trusted to a database query.
- **[QR-002 — Robust recommendation across the input space](../quality-requirements.md#qr-002-robust-recommendation-across-the-valid-input-space)
  (Fault tolerance).** Segment-priority fallback and the empty-basket →
  structured `422 NO_PRODUCTS_AVAILABLE` path are both owned by the engine, so
  the system degrades gracefully instead of failing on sparse filter
  combinations.
- **[QR-003 — Recommendation response time](../quality-requirements.md#qr-003-recommendation-response-time)
  (Time behaviour).** The core path is a single MongoDB query plus in-process
  selection with no per-product external calls. The LLM layer is the main
  latency risk, which is exactly why ADR-001 keeps it off the selection path and
  optional.

## Dynamic View — `POST /recommend` Sequence

![POST /recommend sequence diagram](dynamic-view/recommend-sequence.svg)

> Source: [`dynamic-view/recommend-sequence.puml`](dynamic-view/recommend-sequence.puml)
> (PlantUML). The SVG is the rendered form of that source.

### What scenario this represents

This is the core request: a user finishes the questionnaire and the system
assembles their cosmetic bag. The frontend builds the `/recommend` payload and
calls the backend over HTTPS; the recommendation engine queries MongoDB Atlas,
applies the filters, selects one product per routine step, builds the
justification, and returns the bag — or returns a structured `422` when no
products survive the filters.

### Why it matters to the product

`POST /recommend` is the moment of value in KOYASH: everything else exists to
get the user to this response. It is also the most complex flow — it spans the
frontend, the API, the in-process engine, the database, and (in MVP v2) the
external LLM provider, and it has to behave correctly both when products are
found and when the filter combination leaves nothing. That makes it the right
flow to reason about correctness, robustness, and latency.

### What the sequence shows

1. The frontend assembles the request (`buildRequest`) and posts it.
2. The engine builds the MongoDB query for the two database-side hard filters
   (vegan, cruelty-free) and fetches matching documents.
3. The **allergen filter runs in Python** over the result set (case-insensitive)
   — deliberately in application code, not in the query.
4. For each routine step the engine picks **segment-priority** candidates
   (the user's own budget segment first, then the nearest neighbour), applies
   the **skin-type preference** (specific type, else `any`), and sorts by
   concern match then price.
5. If the basket ends up empty, the engine raises `422 NO_PRODUCTS_AVAILABLE`
   and the frontend shows the "nothing found" state.
6. Otherwise each item gets a justification. In MVP v2 the **LLM layer
   (ADR-001)** optionally enriches the wording via the external provider, and
   **falls back to the rule-based text if the LLM is unavailable** — the LLM
   never changes which products were selected.
7. The engine sorts the bag by routine order, computes the total and notes, and
   returns `RecommendResponse`, which the frontend renders.

### Decisions and quality requirements it helps reason about

- **Integration boundaries.** The diagram makes the two external dependencies
  explicit — MongoDB Atlas on the critical path, and the LLM provider as an
  _optional_ side-branch off the justification step. This is exactly the
  boundary **ADR-001** draws: selection is deterministic and local; the LLM is
  additive and bypassable.
- **[QR-001](../quality-requirements.md#qr-001-allergen-safe-recommendations)
  (allergen correctness).** The allergen filter is a distinct, in-process step
  (step 3), which is what makes it directly testable.
- **[QR-002](../quality-requirements.md#qr-002-robust-recommendation-across-the-valid-input-space)
  (fault tolerance).** The explicit empty-basket `alt` branch shows the graceful
  `422` path instead of a crash or malformed body.
- **[QR-003](../quality-requirements.md#qr-003-recommendation-response-time)
  (time behaviour).** The core path is one database round-trip plus in-process
  work; the only variable-latency call (the LLM) sits in an `opt` block off the
  critical selection path.

## Deployment View

![KOYASH deployment diagram](deployment-view/deployment-diagram.svg)

> Source: [`deployment-view/deployment-diagram.puml`](deployment-view/deployment-diagram.puml)
> (PlantUML). The SVG is the rendered form of that source.

### What the deployment shows

- **Two services on the Railway platform.** The **frontend service** is the
  React + Vite app built to a static bundle and served via `vite preview`
  (bound to `0.0.0.0` on Railway's `PORT`). The **backend service** is the
  FastAPI app packaged as a Docker image (`python:3.12-slim`, Uvicorn, listening
  on Railway's `PORT`).
- **Customer-facing access path.** The user's browser loads the SPA from the
  frontend service over HTTPS, then calls the backend directly over HTTPS
  (`POST /recommend`, `GET /products`) — CORS on the backend allows the
  frontend origin. The backend URL is wired into the frontend at build time via
  `VITE_API_URL`.
- **Stateful infrastructure.** Product data lives in **MongoDB Atlas** (managed
  cloud), reached from the backend over the MongoDB wire protocol (TLS,
  `mongodb+srv`) via the async Motor driver.
- **External service (MVP v2).** The backend calls the external **LLM provider**
  (OpenAI-compatible, gpt-4o-mini) over HTTPS REST, using an API key supplied
  through the environment.
- **Offline data pipeline.** The `db/` seed scripts run from a developer machine
  as a one-off to import the catalog into Atlas; they are not part of the
  deployed runtime or the request path.

### Why this deployment model

- **Railway for both services** keeps the operational surface small for a
  student team: managed builds and TLS, environment-variable configuration, and
  a public URL per service, with no separate orchestration to run. The frontend
  and backend deploy independently, matching their loose HTTP coupling.
- **MongoDB Atlas** removes the need to operate a database: backups, TLS, and
  availability are managed, and the connection string is just another secret in
  the backend environment.
- **The LLM provider stays external and isolated** to one outbound call from the
  backend, consistent with ADR-001 — it can be enabled, disabled, or swapped via
  configuration without touching the deployment topology.

### How it supports or constrains the product

- The browser-to-backend call is a direct cross-origin HTTPS request, so the
  backend must keep correct CORS and the frontend must be built with the right
  `VITE_API_URL` for each environment — a deploy-time configuration concern to
  watch.
- Atlas and the LLM provider are both off-platform network hops; their latency
  and availability are outside Railway. This is why
  [QR-003](../quality-requirements.md#qr-003-recommendation-response-time)
  is measured in-process (excluding network/Atlas round-trips) and why the LLM
  call is optional and bypassable
  ([QR-002](../quality-requirements.md#qr-002-robust-recommendation-across-the-valid-input-space)).

### What to consider when operating it

- Set the backend secrets (`MONGODB_URI`, the LLM API key) and the frontend
  `VITE_API_URL` per environment; never commit them.
- Keep the Atlas network access list and the LLM key budget in mind — the key is
  usage-limited.
- Both services read `PORT` from Railway; the frontend must keep
  `allowedHosts` open for the `*.up.railway.app` domain.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

The maintained ADR set lives in [`adr/`](adr/). Each record is `Accepted` and
addresses one or more quality requirements.

| ADR | Decision | Quality requirements |
|-----|----------|----------------------|
| [ADR-001](adr/ADR-001-rule-based-engine-llm-justification-only.md) | Rule-based selection engine with the LLM as a justification-only layer | [QR-001](../quality-requirements.md#qr-001-allergen-safe-recommendations), [QR-003](../quality-requirements.md#qr-003-recommendation-response-time) |
| [ADR-002](adr/ADR-002-mongodb-atlas-datastore.md) | MongoDB Atlas as the product datastore | [QR-002](../quality-requirements.md#qr-002-robust-recommendation-across-the-valid-input-space) |
| [ADR-003](adr/ADR-003-discrete-budget-segments-nearest-fallback.md) | Budget as discrete segments with nearest-segment fallback | [QR-002](../quality-requirements.md#qr-002-robust-recommendation-across-the-valid-input-space) |

### How the decisions fit the architecture

These three decisions explain the shape of the system shown in the views above:

- **ADR-001** is why the static view draws the LLM as a separate, optional
  component hanging off the justification step rather than inside the engine,
  and why the dynamic view puts the LLM call in an `opt` block off the critical
  path. Keeping selection deterministic is what makes QR-001 (allergen
  correctness) testable and QR-003 (latency) achievable.
- **ADR-002** is why the static and deployment views show a single managed
  datastore (MongoDB Atlas) reached through the Motor data-access component, and
  why the allergen filter sits in application code rather than in the query.
- **ADR-003** is why the engine does per-step, segment-priority selection with
  substitution notes instead of price-band enforcement — the mechanism behind
  the QR-002 graceful-degradation behaviour. Its known tradeoff (assembled total
  vs. displayed budget range) is tracked as PBI-302.
