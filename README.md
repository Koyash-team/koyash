# KOYASH

## About the project

KOYASH is a skincare product recommendation service. The user specifies a
budget, ingredient constraints (vegan, cruelty-free, allergens to avoid) and
the skin concerns they want to address, and the service suggests matching
products and assembles them into a routine (cleanse → tone → serum →
moisturize → spf, plus occasional treatments such as exfoliants and masks).

**Who it's for:** people who find it hard to navigate ingredient lists on
their own and want a skincare routine that fits their budget and
constraints (allergies, vegan/cruelty-free preferences).

**Current status:** MVP v2 — a FastAPI backend with rule-based recommendation on
top of MongoDB Atlas (`GET /products`, `POST /recommend`): skin-type matching, an
honest budget presentation, a special-condition safety filter (e.g. no retinoids
in pregnancy), and an optional LLM justification layer (gpt-4o-mini,
justification-only, off by default). A React + Vite frontend (storytelling and
short questionnaires, results screens) is deployed and wired end-to-end.
Authentication and saved cosmetic-bag history are planned for a later Sprint — see
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

## Running locally

### Via Docker Compose (recommended)

Requirements: Docker + Docker Compose.

1. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and fill in `MONGODB_URI`
   with your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
2. From the repository root:

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file backend/.env up --build
   ```

3. Check:
   - <http://localhost:8000/health> — should return `{"status": "ok"}`
   - <http://localhost:8000/docs> — Swagger UI with the `/products` and `/recommend` endpoints

### Without Docker (backend directly)

Requirements: Python 3.12, pip.

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env   # then fill in MONGODB_URI
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend (local dev)

Requirements: Node.js 20+, npm.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # serves the app on http://localhost:5173
```

The frontend calls the backend at `http://localhost:8000` by default. To point
it at a different API (for example the deployed one), create `frontend/.env`:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Start the backend first (see above), or set `VITE_API_URL` to the deployed API.
See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for more detail.

### Database layer (`db/`)

Scripts for loading and checking the MongoDB Atlas data (import from the
source dataset, JSON-schema validators, sanity checks) — see
[db/README.md](db/README.md).

## Link checking

CI runs [lychee](https://lychee.cli.rs) on every pull request and on every
push to `main` (see
[.github/workflows/lychee.yml](.github/workflows/lychee.yml)), checking every
link in every Markdown file in the repo — including `reports/` — both
repo-relative links and public external URLs.

A couple of links are narrowly excluded, with justification in
[lychee.toml](lychee.toml):

- `http://localhost:8000/...` (in "Running locally" above and in the
  `reports/week2/mvp-v0-report.md` smoke-check) — local development URLs that
  are never reachable from a CI runner.
- `https://youtu.be/...` links (the current MVP v1 demo above and the
  historical MVP v0 demo in `reports/week2/mvp-v0-report.md`) — YouTube blocks
  automated HTTP clients at the TLS/bot-detection layer, so lychee can never
  get a real response; the lychee.toml exclusion is a pattern match on any
  `youtu.be` link, not a single hard-coded URL. Manually verified on
  2026-06-21 that the current demo (<https://youtu.be/SDuBlborKr0>) plays
  normally in a browser; the MVP v0 link was verified on 2026-06-13.
